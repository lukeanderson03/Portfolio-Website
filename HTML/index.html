        <h3>2023 - Present</h3>
        <p>I transferred from Wayne State University to Michigan State University over
                the summer of 2023. I changed my major from computer science to information
                science after transferring. During my time attending MSU, I have grown as a
                student, person, and front-end developer.</p>

        <h3>2021 - 2023</h3>
        <p>After completing high school in 2021, I continued my education at Wayne State
            University. During my time at WSU, I worked towards completing a computer
            science degree. I enjoyed studying computer science, and learned a lot of the basics
            during my two years at Wayne State. Originally, I believed a school like Wayne would
            fit my needs best. It was smaller, close to home, and in an urban environment.
            However, during my sophomore year I started to feel like I needed a change of pace.
            I decided to apply for a transfer over the summer of 2023, and when my application
            was accepted I had a decision to make. The prerequisites for the computer science
            programs at Wayne State and Michigan State were different. This means that if I were
            to transfer to MSU I would have to use my junior year to take those classes to be
            able to apply to the computer science program. This would have set my graduation year
            back by at least a year. After some thought, I decided I would transfer schools and
            switch my major to information science.

        <h2>Recently</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Since transferring to MSU, I have been spending most of my time learning front-end
            web development. I have been working on the CodeCademy full-stack developer pathway
            mostly while also learning from other online resources like YouTube and Stack Overflow.
            I plan on completing this course to recieve my certificate, however, as of right now I 
            have mostly learned just the font-end side of things. CodeCademy has taught me a lot of
            things I wouldn't have learned with a computer science degree and I am very grateful
            for that. As of right now, my focus has been learning JavaScript and React. So far,
            everything is going great!
