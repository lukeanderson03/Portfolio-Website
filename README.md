#Portfolio Website
--------------------
###About
- This is a basic portfolio website I created to showcase my skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- As I progress through my front-end development journey, I will be showcasing my projects on this site.
- This is a work in progress, and I will add more content as I progess.
- I will be adding contact and projects pages in the future.
