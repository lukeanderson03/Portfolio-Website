# Portfolio Website
----
### About
- This is a basic portfolio website I created to showcase my skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- As I progress through my front-end development journey, I will be showcasing my projects on this site.
- This is a work in progress, and I will add more content as I progess.
- I will be adding contact and projects pages in the future.
- At the moment, I am working on adding JavaScript functionality to the page.

### Details
- I decided to display html tags around each section as a creative choice, I may change this in the future.
- The website is completely responsive depending on the screen size.
- My website was made responsive using tools like flexbox and media querys.
- I created the logo/picture of myself in Adobe Photoshop.
