            Hello! My name is Luke Anderson and I am an<span style="color: #eb5e28">
            Information Science</span> major with an interest in 
            <span style="color: #eb5e28">information technology, IT/cybersecurity, 
            and web development.</span> I have spent the past six months learning
            website development using languages such
            as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also in
            the process of obtaining the <span style="color: #eb5e28">Google IT Support professional certificate</span>. 
            I am interested in working
            with companies to help implement <span style="color: #eb5e28">IT</span>
            and <span style="color: #eb5e28">security</span> practices to ensure their success.
            I am very project-driven, and learn best when working with others. If you are
            looking for an innovative, collaborative, ambitous, and passionate worker feel

        <p class="div_p">Since switching majors after transferring to Michigan State University, I have found myself programming more than ever (and yes,
            this may partly be due to the new amount of free time I've experienced without a comp sci
            workload).
            While I really enjoyed studying computer science at Wayne State, the change to information
            science has taught me things I wouldn't have learned with my old degree. I've been learning
            more about how users interact with technology and what developers can do to make it easier
            and more efficient. This has helped me understand how important it is to think about users
            when implementing technical and design choices.

        <p class="div_p">After completing high school in 2021, I continued my education at Wayne State University.
            During my time at WSU, I worked towards completing a computer science degree.
            I enjoyed studying computer science and learned a lot of the basics during my two
            years at Wayne State. Originally, I believed a school like Wayne would fit my needs
            best. It was smaller, close to home, and in an urban environment. However, during my
            sophomore year, I started to feel like I needed a change of pace. I decided to apply
            for a transfer over the summer of 2023, and when my application was accepted I had a
            decision to make. The prerequisites for the computer science programs at Wayne State
            and Michigan State were different. This means that if I were to transfer to MSU I would
            have to use my junior year to take those classes to be able to apply to the computer
            science program. This would have set my graduation year back by at least a year.
            After some thought, I decided I would transfer schools and switch my major to
            information science.

        <p class="div_p">I am almost done with the Codecademy front-end engineer certificate! I've 
            learned a lot throughout this journey and am happy with the skills I have gained.
            I have also recently started the Google IT support professional certificate. I plan
            to have this certificate by July 2024. After this, I want to start studying for the 
            CompTIA Net+ certificate. I know this certificate is difficult and takes time to study for,
            however, I am very motivated and abmitous and plan to have this certificate by the end of 
            summer 2024 as well!
