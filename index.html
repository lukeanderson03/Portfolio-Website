        <p class="div_p">Since switching majors after transferring to Michigan State University, I have found myself programming more than ever (and yes,
            this may partly be due to the new amount of free time I've experienced without a comp sci
            workload).
            While I really enjoyed studying computer science at Wayne State, the change to information
            science has taught me things I wouldn't have learned with my old degree. I've been learning
            more about how users interact with technology and what developers can do to make it easier
            and more efficient. This has helped me understand how important it is to think about users
            when implementing technical and design choices.

        <h4 class="tags">&lt;wsu&gt;</h4>
        <p class="div_p">After completing high school in 2021, I continued my education at Wayne State University.
            During my time at WSU, I worked towards completing a computer science degree.
            I enjoyed studying computer science and learned a lot of the basics during my two
            years at Wayne State. Originally, I believed a school like Wayne would fit my needs
            best. It was smaller, close to home, and in an urban environment. However, during my
            sophomore year, I started to feel like I needed a change of pace. I decided to apply
            for a transfer over the summer of 2023, and when my application was accepted I had a
            decision to make. The prerequisites for the computer science programs at Wayne State
            and Michigan State were different. This means that if I were to transfer to MSU I would
            have to use my junior year to take those classes to be able to apply to the computer
            science program. This would have set my graduation year back by at least a year.
            After some thought, I decided I would transfer schools and switch my major to
            information science.

        <p class="div_p">I have been spending most of my time learning front-end web development.
            I have been working on the Codecademy full-stack developer pathway mostly
            while also learning from other online resources like YouTube and Stack Overflow.
            I plan on completing this course to receive my certificate, however, as of right now,
            I have mostly learned just the front-end side of things. CodeCademy has taught me many
            things I wouldn't have learned with a computer science degree and I am very grateful for
            that. As of right now, my focus has been learning JavaScript and React. So far,
            everything is going great!
